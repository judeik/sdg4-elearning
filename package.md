# 🛠️ Create a package.json

- First, initialize a new Node project (this will create a fresh package.json):

```bash
npm init -y
```

## ⚛️ Install React and Core Packagesbash

```bash
npm install react react-dom react-scripts
```

## 🎨 Install Other Dependencies (from the deleted package.json)

- Based on your project, install them one by one (or all together):

```bash
npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap react-router-dom lucide-react
```

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Tools (optional but recommended)

- These are not required to run, but for linting/formatting:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-react prettier
```

## 🏃 Run Your Project

- Now you can run:

```bash
npm start
```
